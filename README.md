# backtrack-rs
<!-- cargo-sync-readme start -->

`backtrack-rs` lets you define and solve [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) problems
succinctly.

Problems are defined by their *scope* and *checks* against possible solutions.
The [Scope](https://docs.rs/backtrack-rs/latest/backtrack-rs/problem/trait.Scope.html) determines length and allowed
values for possible solution. The [Check](https://docs.rs/backtrack-rs/latest/backtrack-rs/problem/trait.Check.html)
or [CheckInc](https://docs.rs/backtrack-rs/latest/backtrack-rs/problem/trait.CheckInc.html) trait determines whether
a particular combination of values is satisfactory.

It is required that partial solutions, i.e. shorter solutions
than in scope must satisfy if a complete solutions should as well.
[Solvers](https://docs.rs/backtrack-rs/latest/backtrack-rs/solvers/) borrow the problem for the duration of their search
for [candidate solutions](https://docs.rs/backtrack-rs/latest/backtrack-rs/solve/enum.CandidateSolution.html).

## Basic Usage
We define the problem of counting down with a limited set of numbers and solve iteratively.
```rust
use backtrack_rs::problem::{Check, Scope};
use backtrack_rs::solvers::IterSolveNaive;
// helper trait to filter solutions of interest
use backtrack_rs::solve::IterSolveExt;

/// Obtain permutations of some 3 descending numbers
struct CountDown {}

impl Scope for CountDown {
    fn size(&self) -> usize { 3 }
    fn domain(&self) -> Vec<usize> { (0..=3).collect() }
}

impl Check for CountDown{
    fn extends_sat(&self, solution: &[usize], x_l: usize) -> bool {
        solution.last().map_or(true, |last| *last > x_l)
    }
}

let solver = IterSolveNaive::new(&CountDown{});
let mut sats = solver.sat_iter();

assert_eq!(sats.next(), Some(vec![2, 1, 0]));
assert_eq!(sats.next(), Some(vec![3, 1, 0]));
assert_eq!(sats.next(), Some(vec![3, 2, 0]));
assert_eq!(sats.next(), Some(vec![3, 2, 1]));
assert_eq!(sats.next(), None);
```
## Incremental Check
If your checks can be formulated with a reduced solution,
implement [CheckInc](https://docs.rs/backtrack-rs/latest/backtrack-rs/problem/trait.CheckInc.html) instead.

The same result as above can be formulated by "computing"
the last item at each step. This approach makes more sense if
actual work on more than one prior value needs to be peformed
for any given sat check.

```rust
use backtrack_rs::problem::{CheckInc, Scope};
// ...
impl CheckInc for CountDown{
    type Accumulator = usize;

    fn fold_acc(&self, accu: Option<Self::Accumulator>, x: &usize) -> Self::Accumulator {
        // only last value is of interest for checking
        *x
    }

    fn accu_sat(&self, accu: Option<&Self::Accumulator>, x: &usize, index: usize) -> bool {
       accu.map_or(true, |last| last > x)
    }
}
// since `CheckInc` impls `Check`, the same solver as in example above can be used
// todo: specialize solver to actually realize performance advantage
// ...
```

## Examples
Checkout the `examples` folder for example implementations.
```bash
# print sequence of numbers which sum up to a minimum value but not more
cargo run --example total_sum | grep Sat
```
